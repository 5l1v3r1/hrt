HackRF Toolkit
==============================================================
<hr>

Overview:
---

* An attempt to modularize some of the features from GNU-Radio Companion for the HackRF

Goals:
---
* Give the user an easy way to switch between receiving and transmission without closing out the session
* Make the HackRF a life-saving 2-way communications tool in the event of disaster

To Do List:
---

* Add software amplification boost options for tx/rx modes
* Add the WAV and Siren flows to hrt
* Allow the user to change pitch and tone for the Siren flow
* Design a low-cost easy-to-build amplifier solution to increase the reception and transmission range
* Design a low-cost easy-to-build antenna solution for usage with different frequencies

How to use:
---
* git clone https://github.com/stryngs/hrt.git && cd hrt && python ./hrt
  * Yes, that simple!
* The menu is fairly self-explanatory
